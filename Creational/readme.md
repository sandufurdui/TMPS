## ***Creational Design Patterns***


----
## Introduction:
A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design. The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms. Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

## Main tasks:
1. Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed).
2. Select a domain area for the sample project.
3. Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed.
4. Based on the previous point, implement atleast 3 creational design patterns in your project.


## Creational Design Pattern:
1. [Abstract factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern "Abstract factory pattern")  groups object factories that have a common theme.
2.  [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern "Builder pattern")  constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
3.  [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern "Factory method pattern")  creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
4.   [Prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern "Prototype pattern")  creates objects by cloning an existing object.
5.    [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern "Singleton pattern")  restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
