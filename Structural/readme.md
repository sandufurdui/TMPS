# ***TMPS Lab #2***
## ***Structural Design Patterns***


----

## Objectives:
1.    Study structural design patterns
2. Implement some additional functionalities using structural design patterns.


##  Used Design Patterns:
1. Adaptor
2. Decorator
3. Flyweight
4. Composite

## Implementation
**1. Adaptor**
	An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles.
**2.Decorator**
	The decorator pattern can be used to extend (decorate) the functionality of a certain object statically, or in some cases at run-time, independently of other instances of the same class, provided some groundwork is done at design time.
**3. Flyweight**
	The performance is increased by creating a pool of common Strings and assigning multiple reference variables to the ones with the same content, and only creating new Strings when no match is found.
**4.Composite**
	The greatest benefit of this approach is that you don’t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree.
